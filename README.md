# Verilog & Digital Design Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of projects and labs from my **Digital Systems Design** course. It showcases my practical experience in digital logic design, computer architecture, and hardware description languages (HDLs), bridging theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation and simulation.

## Projects Overview

Below is a summary of the projects included in this portfolio. Each project folder contains its own detailed `README.md` with specific implementation details, block diagrams, and simulation results.

## Hands-On Hardware Labs (Not Included in Repo)

Please note that Labs 1-4 and 9 are not present in this repository. These assignments were foundational, hands-on labs implemented directly on breadboards using discrete `74-series` logic gates, wires, and switches. They provided essential experience in:

- Reading component datasheets.
- Debugging physical circuits and timing issues.
- Understanding the practical behavior of logic gates.
- Interfacing with physical I/O (switches and LEDs).

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/verilog-portfolio.git`
2.  **Navigate to a project folder:** `cd verilog-portfolio/lab-05`
3.  **Review the Project-Specific README:** Each folder contains a `README.md` with instructions on how to run simulations and understand the design.
4.  **Simulate:** The projects were simulated using `Vivado's built-in simulator`. Testbench files (`_tb.v`) are provided for each module.
