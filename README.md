# Verilog Digital Design Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of labs from my university coursework in digital systems design. It showcases my practical skills in designing, implementing, and simulating fundamental digital logic circuits using Verilog.

## Projects Overview

Below is a summary of the projects included in this portfolio. Each project folder contains the Verilog source files for that lab. For more detailed explanations, consider adding a dedicated `README.md` inside each lab folder.

## Technologies & Tools

*   **Hardware Description Languages:** Verilog
*   **Simulation & Synthesis Tools (Example):**
    *   Xilinx Vivado
    *   ModelSim / QuestaSim
    *   Intel Quartus


## Hands-On Hardware Labs (Not Included in Repo)

Please note that **Labs 1-4 and 9** are not present in this repository. These assignments were foundational, hands-on labs implemented directly on breadboards using discrete `74-series` logic gates. They provided essential experience in:

- Reading component datasheets.
- Debugging physical circuits and timing issues.
- Understanding the practical behavior of logic gates.
- Interfacing with physical I/O (switches and LEDs).

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/gnimm05/verilog-portfolio.git`
2.  **Navigate to a project folder:** `cd verilog-portfolio/lab5`
3.  **Review the Verilog files:** Open the `.v` files in a text editor or an IDE like VS Code with Verilog extensions.
4.  **Simulate:** Use a simulation tool like Vivado or ModelSim to test the designs. Testbench files may need to be created to verify functionality.
